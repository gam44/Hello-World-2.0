### Animal Shelters in Durham
![Gracie Meisel](images/Screenshotofwork.png?raw=true "Gracie Meisel")

I created this image to show the large number of animals in need of homes in the Durham area. The green circles serve as place marks for where each shelter is located, and the number next to the names of each shelter shows how many animals at that shelter are up for adoption. Although shelters provide immediate care for orphaned animals,they in no way serve as suitable forever homes. The numbers demonstrate just how many animals have been abandoned and are looking for loving homes. 

I chose the green color for the shelter locations to ensure that they stood out against the light yellow background. I also wanted to ensure that the names of each shelter were clear and easy for the viewer to read. If you click on each shelter name, a picture of a young girl and a dog appear. I specifically wanted this image to hover over the shelters to show the loving relationship that can be formed between a human and their pet after adoption. Although this picture shows up when you click anywhere, the hope is that when the viewer specifically clicks on the shelter, it will prompt the viewer to imagine the aforementioned relationship. 

If the mouse is on the right side of the computer screen, the sweeping black curves cover all of the animal shelters in Durham. You can still make out the names and locations, but the image is compromised and is not seen as clearly. Once you move the mouse to the left, the black lines slowly peel away and reveal a much clearer map of the shelters. This feature demonstrates the public's general ignorance about the importance of adopting animals from shelters and the quantity of animals that are forced to live their whole lives in enclosed shelters. The hope is that this interactive graphic enlightens the viewership and shows them the reality (the clear map).

Lastly, I chose to include the four images of the paw print inside the hand to further demonstrate the deep bond that can be formed between humans and the animals they adopt.
