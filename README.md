### Hello World 2.0

I significantly changed my original Hello World sketch for Hello World 2.0 to incorporate both my classmates' feedback from the critique and a concept that stuck with me from Wolfgang Laib's video interview. 

In Laib's video, he spoke about how he was so drawn to pollen because it represents life and new beginnings while he felt that his life had been heavily defined by death and tragedy. I appreciated this idea of showing the opposite of reality, and I wanted to incorporate it into my sketch. So, I decided to use one of my own photographs that I took in Argentina of a beautiful mountain range with green grass and trees in the forefront of the photo. Rather than showing the dismal reality of how many animals are stuck in shelters, I wanted to show the animals "running" free (or at least "gliding" free since we were unable to get the gif function to work) into the green, open land. 

Although I wanted to show this sense of freedom and escape, I also wanted to still incorporate the idea that a few of my classmates brought up regarding the net-/cage-like interactive image I had created in Hello World version 1. Therefore, I decided to keep that part in Hello World 2.0 and allow the viewer to move the cage away with his/her mouse, which would trigger the animals gliding out of their captivity. 

I had a lot of fun playing with the code that gets the animals to glide to the forefront as well as playing with the code that starts the gliding movement when the mouse is half way across the screen. I like the happier image that my Hello World 2.0 creates while still getting the point across that the animals are originally caged.
